# Exploratory data analysis 

## Univariate analysis

In this first part of our EDA, we will explore each variable on its own, before looking at the relationship between different variables.

### Plots of each variable over time: 

```{r}
#Flights plot 
ts_data %>% autoplot(Flights) +
  labs(title = "Flights over time", x = "Date", y = "Number of Flights")

#Price plot
ts_data %>% autoplot(Price) +
  labs(title = "Brent Oil Prices 2019 onwards", x = "Date", y = "Price")

#temp plot
ts_data %>% autoplot(temp) +
  labs(title = "Temperature over time", x = "Date", y = "Temperature in Celsius")

#precip plot
ts_data %>% autoplot(precip) +
  labs(title = "Precipitation over time", x = "Date", y = "Precipitation")

#snow plot
ts_data %>% autoplot(snow) +
  labs(title = "Snow over time", x = "Date", y = "Snow")

#windspeed plot
ts_data %>% autoplot(windspeed) +
  labs(title = "Windspeed over time", x = "Date", y = "Windspeed")

#visibility plot
ts_data %>% autoplot(visibility) +
  labs(title = "Visibility over time", x = "Date", y = "Visibility")

#humidity plot
ts_data %>% autoplot(humidity) +
  labs(title = "Humidity over time", x = "Date", y = "Humidity")


```

## Bivariate analysis

In this section of our EDA, we will explore the relationships between our variables, which will help us decide which to keep for our final forecasting analysis.
