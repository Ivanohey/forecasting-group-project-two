# Forecasting Flights

After having forecasted and selected our covariates, it's time to forecast the number of flights. 

First, let's create a table that contains all the forecasts from our covariates: 

```{r}
#Join all covariate forecast tables together
cov_fc <- left_join(forecast_table_tslm_temp, forecast_table_tslm_precip, by = "Date")
cov_fc <- left_join(cov_fc, forecast_table_tslm_windspeed, by = "Date")
cov_fc <- left_join(cov_fc, forecast_table_tslm_humidity, by = "Date")

# round columns 2 to 5 to 2 decimals
cov_fc <- cov_fc %>%
  mutate_at(vars(2:5), ~ round(., 2))

```
